                <p>Me and my partner <span class="bold-name">Rose</span> went to chocolate hills in bohol.</p>
                <p>Chocolate hills is one of the main attraction here in bohol because of it's unique geological formation. Where hundred of of rounded hills turns to brown in summer season creating a visually stunning place for tourist.</p>
                <p>Aside from chocolate hills. My partner and I tried and had lunch on Loboc river cruise which give you a unique experience on having a buffet lunch while exploring the wide area of bohol country side. </p>
